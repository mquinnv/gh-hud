# gh-hud Fixes Applied

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ **Exit Functionality ('q' key doesn't quit)**
- **Problem**: The quit key wasn't working properly and app would restart
- **Root Cause**: 
  - Blessed screen event handling wasn't configured correctly
  - Running with `pnpm dev` (tsx watch) auto-restarts on exit
- **Solution**: 
  - Fixed keyboard event handling in blessed screen configuration
  - Added proper cleanup method that stops timers and destroys the screen
  - Added process signal handlers for SIGINT and SIGTERM
  - **Important**: Use `node dist/index.js` not `pnpm dev` for testing exit functionality

### 2. ✅ **Removed Intrusive Loading Dialog**
- **Problem**: Centered loading dialog appeared during refreshes, blocking the UI
- **Solution**: 
  - Replaced centered loading dialog with status bar updates
  - Added `showLoadingInStatus()` method that updates bottom status bar
  - Loading indication now shows "Refreshing..." in status bar without blocking content
  - Main grid remains visible during refresh operations

### 3. ✅ **Enhanced Job Step Visibility**
- **Problem**: Limited context around active job steps
- **Solution**: 
  - Show 2-3 completed steps before current running step
  - Show 3-4 upcoming steps after current step  
  - Added visual indicators with different colors for completed vs upcoming steps
  - Include step timing information (duration) for completed steps
  - Added progress indicator showing "step X of Y total steps"
  - Current running step highlighted with ▶ symbol and bold text

### 4. ✅ **Fixed Refresh-on-Every-Keypress Issue**
- **Problem**: App was refreshing every time any key was pressed
- **Root Cause**: Blessed was emitting 'refresh' events on every keypress/render
- **Solution**: 
  - Changed from generic 'refresh' event to custom 'manual-refresh' event
  - Separated manual refresh (user pressing 'r') from auto-refresh (timer)
  - Added proper event isolation to prevent cascade effects

### 5. ✅ **Fixed Help Dialog Issues**
- **Problem**: Help screen would close when refresh occurred, limited key support
- **Solution**: 
  - Added modal state tracking (`isModalOpen` flag)
  - Prevented screen updates when modal dialogs are open
  - Fixed help dialog to close with both 'h' and 'Esc' keys
  - Updated help text to reflect actual behavior
  - Help dialog now stays open during auto-refreshes

### 6. ✅ **Improved Selected Card Visibility**
- **Problem**: Hard to tell which card is selected (only subtle cyan border)
- **Solution**: 
  - Added inverted header row for selected card
  - Selected card's header (repo name, workflow name, run number) now has inverted background
  - Much more visible than just the border color change
  - Makes navigation with arrow keys/j/k very obvious

## Technical Details

### Key Files Modified:
- `src/dashboard.ts` - Main UI logic, key bindings, card formatting
- `src/app.ts` - Refresh handling, event management
- `src/types.ts` - Type definitions for workflow steps

### Key Methods Added/Modified:
- `setupKeyBindings()` - Improved key event handling
- `cleanup()` - Proper app shutdown
- `showLoadingInStatus()` - Non-intrusive loading indication  
- `formatWorkflowContent()` - Enhanced step display and selected card styling
- `updateWorkflows()` - Modal-aware screen updates

### Testing Instructions:
1. Build: `pnpm build`
2. Run: `node dist/index.js` (NOT `pnpm dev`)
3. Test navigation with arrow keys or j/k
4. Test 'q' to quit (should exit cleanly)
5. Test 'h' to show/hide help 
6. Test 'r' for manual refresh (shows in status bar)
7. Verify selected card has inverted header

## Debug Information Removed:
All debug console.error statements have been removed for clean production use.

## Known Considerations:
- Auto-refresh occurs every 5 seconds (configurable)
- Completed workflows are shown but can be dismissed
- Help dialog stays open during refreshes
- Exit functionality works best with built version, not dev mode
